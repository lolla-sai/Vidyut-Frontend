## Installation

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Lessons Learned

As my first project under industry mentorship from OneShield Inc, I realized the importance of planning, and initial research phase in a project. High Level Design Documents, Entity Relationship Diagrams, Flow diagrams, Requirement analysis - all these helped in better understanding the problem at hand.

Through this project I also learnt Typescript, and the benefits it brings in as a statically typed language.

We won the 2nd place for this, and the prize made it all worth the effort ðŸ˜Š
